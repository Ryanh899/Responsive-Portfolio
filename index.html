            I am a Software Engineer. I was born on October 5, 1999 in Laguna Niguel, California. I live and have lived
            in San Clemente, California my whole life. I attended Capistrano Valley Christian Schools and graduated in
            2018. While at Capistrano Valley Christian Schools I worked at a local restaurant named Café Del Sol as a
            cashier/server. I also worked as a professional portrait photographer, often for senior photos and family
            portraits.

        <p class="about">
            After High School I attended Saddleback College with the intentions of transferring to a four-year
            university and attaining a degree in business with an emphasis in finance. While at Saddleback College I was
            still working at Café Del Sol as well as running my photography business. I branched out my professional
            photography to the surf world and started shooting as an independent contractor for Hobie Surfboards. Now I
            am studying Software Engineering at UCI as part of a full stack coding boot-camp.
